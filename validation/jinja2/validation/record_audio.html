    <button id="recNewEntryButton" class="button button--neutral button--right">Record a new Entry</button>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Use this page to record or re-record entries in Plains Cree. Start by entering the transcription (in Cree)
    and the translation (in English) for the word or sentence you are going to record. Try to spell the Cree word(s)
        as correctly as possible, as these recordings will be added to an existing entry if one exists.</p>
    <p>Next, click the "Record" button. It will likely ask you permission to use your microphone, please click "Allow". You are now recording, as indicated
    by the word "Recording..." on the button. When you are finished, press "Stop". Listen to your recording. If you're happy
    with how it sounds, click "Save" next to that recording. Please record yourself saying this word or phrase up to 3 times,
    clicking save next to each good recording and ignoring any that you are unhappy with. To record a new word or phrase,
    click the "Record a new Entry" button.</p>
    <p>Please note that pressing the "Record a new Entry" button or reloading the page will cause all your current unsaved
        recordings to disappear, so make sure you're done with them and have saved all the good ones before doing either of those actions.</p>
