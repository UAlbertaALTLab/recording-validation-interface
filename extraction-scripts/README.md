Eddie,

Sorry for not replying earlier. I worked from several scripts to generate that list. I was working on automating the whole process to a single script, but I have been unable to overcome a final issue or two.

The basic idea is to extract the annotation information, which I did via Praat (a scriptable acoustic analysis program used by phoneticians). I then wrapped this in a shell script to iterate over all of the directories with annotations in them. This is where we seemed to develop some gaps, so I don't think my shell is iterating right.

Those scripts output the extracted sound files, plus a table of metadata. I then have a final script to collect that information in the HTML table you saw.

I am going to see if I have a summary document outlining the name, location, and function of each of these scripts. If I do, I'll share it with you. If not, I'll create it and send it your way today.
